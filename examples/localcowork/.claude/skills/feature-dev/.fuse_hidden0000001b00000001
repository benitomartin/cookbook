# Feature Development Skill — Doc-Sync Checklist

> MANDATORY TRIGGERS: "add feature", "new feature", "implement", "build", "new tool", "add tool",
> "new endpoint", "add server", "modify tool", "change tool signature", "update tool", "new use case".
> Also trigger whenever a session involves creating or modifying source files that affect user-facing
> behavior, tool contracts, or architecture.

## Purpose

This skill ensures documentation stays in sync whenever features are added or changed.
Claude Code reads this **before writing any feature code** and follows the checklist **after the code is written**.

## The Doc-Sync Rule

**Every feature change touches at least two files: the code AND the docs.**
If you changed behavior but only committed code, the docs are now lying.

## Pre-Flight: Identify Change Type

Before coding, classify the change. This determines which docs need updating.

| Change Type | Example |
|---|---|
| **New MCP tool** | Adding `filesystem.rename_file` |
| **Modified tool signature** | Changing params/returns on an existing tool |
| **New MCP server** | Adding a 14th server (e.g., `browser`) |
| **Agent Core change** | Modifying ToolRouter, ConversationManager, ContextWindowManager |
| **Frontend component** | New UI component or changing confirmation flow |
| **New use case** | Adding UC-11 |
| **Shared service change** | Modifying model-gateway, state-manager, logger, config-loader |
| **Infrastructure** | Build system, CI, dev tooling, scripts |

## Doc-Sync Matrix

After the code is written and tests pass, update every file marked for your change type.

### New MCP Tool

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `docs/mcp-tool-registry.yaml` | Add tool definition (params, returns, confirmation, undo metadata) |
| `mcp-servers/<server>/README.md` | Add tool to the server's tool list |
| `PROGRESS.yaml` | Update workstream status, add to `tools:` list if applicable |
| Smoke test file | Create `<tool_name>.smoke.test.ts` or `<tool_name>_smoke_test.py` |
| Unit test file | Create `<tool_name>.test.ts` or `test_<tool_name>.py` |

### Modified Tool Signature

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `docs/mcp-tool-registry.yaml` | Update params, returns, or metadata to match new signature |
| `docs/architecture-decisions/` | **Write an ADR** if this is a breaking change (see CLAUDE.md Breaking Changes) |
| Existing tests | Update to match new contract |
| Smoke test | Update if params changed |

### New MCP Server

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `docs/mcp-tool-registry.yaml` | Add all tools for the new server |
| `docs/PRD.md` | Update if the server adds new capabilities described in the PRD |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Add server to the Key Paths section if not already listed |
| `docs/contributing.md` | Update if new language or pattern is introduced |
| `PROGRESS.yaml` | Update workstream status |
| `.claude/skills/mcp-server-dev/SKILL.md` | Update if new patterns are established |

### Agent Core Change

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `docs/patterns/context-window-management.md` | If context budget or eviction changed |
| `docs/patterns/human-in-the-loop.md` | If confirmation flow changed |
| `docs/patterns/error-handling.md` | If error handling strategy changed |
| `docs/architecture-decisions/` | **Write an ADR** for any change listed in CLAUDE.md Breaking Changes |
| `PROGRESS.yaml` | Update workstream status |

### Frontend Component

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `docs/patterns/human-in-the-loop.md` | If confirmation UI changed |
| `docs/PRD.md` | If new UI section is described in PRD |
| `PROGRESS.yaml` | Update workstream status |

### New Use Case

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `docs/PRD.md` | Add UC definition if not already there |
| `tests/integration/` | Create `uc<N>_*.test.ts` |
| `tests/fixtures/` | Add sample data for the UC |
| `.claude/skills/tool-chain-test/SKILL.md` | Add UC fixture layout and expected chain |
| `PROGRESS.yaml` | Update workstream status |

### Shared Service Change

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture-decisions/` | **Write an ADR** (mandatory — shared services are a breaking change surface) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Update Shared Services Contract table if interface changed |
| `PROGRESS.yaml` | Update workstream status |

### Infrastructure

| File | What to Update |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Update Commands section if new scripts or commands added |
| `docs/contributing.md` | Update if dev workflow changed |
| `PROGRESS.yaml` | Update workstream status |
| `scripts/setup-dev.sh` | Update if new dev dependencies introduced |

## Post-Flight: Self-Check

After committing, mentally verify:

1. **Registry sync** — Does `docs/mcp-tool-registry.yaml` match every implemented tool?
2. **Test coverage** — Does every new tool have a unit test AND a smoke test?
3. **ADR written** — Did any breaking change surface get modified without an ADR?
4. **PROGRESS.yaml** — Is the workstream status accurate?
5. **README/contributing** — Would a new contributor understand the change?

If any answer is "no", fix it before moving on.

## Quick Reference: Always Update These

No matter what type of change, these files almost always need a touch:

- `PROGRESS.yaml` — workstream status
- The relevant test file(s) — unit + smoke
- `docs/mcp-tool-registry.yaml` — if any tool was added or changed
